## Overview

Collaborative research project with the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard to create shared embedding spaces between Chandra X-ray Observatory event data and astronomical research papers using contrastive learning.

## Challenge

Astronomical research involves two distinct modalities that traditionally exist in separate silos:
- **Observational Data**: Raw event files with time, energy, and position measurements
- **Scientific Literature**: Research papers describing and interpreting observations

The goal was to create a unified embedding space enabling cross-modal retrieval between data and text.

## Approach

Developed contrastive learning framework with dual encoders:
- **Event Encoder**: Processes Chandra event lists using CNN/Transformer hybrid
- **Text Encoder**: Processes research papers using pre-trained language models (SciBERT)
- **Contrastive Loss**: NT-Xent loss to align embeddings in shared space

Used hard negative mining and temperature scaling for efficient training on paired observation-paper datasets.

## Technologies

- **PyTorch**: Model development and training
- **Python**: Core implementation and data processing
- **RunPod**: GPU infrastructure
- **Pinecone**: Vector storage for similarity matching

## Impact

Achieved >85% top-5 retrieval accuracy for paper-to-data matching, enabling intelligent data retrieval, literature-guided analysis, and automated annotation of astronomical observations. Embeddings cluster meaningfully by astronomical object type and generalize to unseen source types.
