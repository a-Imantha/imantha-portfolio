## Project Overview

AstroMind is a personal research project exploring the intersection of multi-agent systems, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and astrophysics workflows. As both an ML engineer and amateur astrophotographer, I built this system to automate and enhance various aspects of astronomical image acquisition, processing, and analysis.

## Motivation

Astrophotography involves numerous repetitive but knowledge-intensive tasks:
- Planning imaging sessions based on object visibility, moon phase, weather
- Plate solving (determining exact coordinates from images)
- Object identification and catalog cross-referencing
- Processing pipeline selection and optimization
- Analysis of image quality and astronomical features

These tasks require domain knowledge spread across catalogs, papers, and community wisdom. AstroMind uses a multi-agent architecture with RAG to make this knowledge accessible through natural language.

## Architecture

### Agent System
Built on a multi-agent framework with specialized agents:

**Vision Agent**
- Identifies celestial objects in images
- Performs astrometry (plate solving)
- Detects artifacts and quality issues
- Suggests processing improvements

**Research Agent**
- Queries astronomical databases (SIMBAD, NED, etc.)
- Retrieves scientific papers and data
- Synthesizes information from multiple sources
- Generates research summaries

**Processing Agent**
- Optimizes image stacking parameters
- Recommends calibration procedures
- Automates routine processing tasks
- Monitors processing quality

**Coordinator Agent**
- Orchestrates multi-agent workflows
- Manages task decomposition
- Handles agent communication
- Ensures goal achievement

### Technical Stack

**Backend**
- Python with FastAPI for API server
- LangChain for agent orchestration
- Custom fine-tuned vision models
- PostgreSQL for data persistence

**Frontend**
- Next.js with TypeScript
- Real-time agent communication via WebSockets
- Interactive visualizations with D3.js
- Image viewer with annotations

## Key Features

### Natural Language Queries
Users can ask complex questions in plain English:
- "What nebulae are visible from my location tonight?"
- "Process this image and identify any galaxies"
- "Compare my Orion image to professional data"

### Automated Workflows
Pre-built and custom workflows for common tasks:
- End-to-end image processing pipelines
- Object catalogs and field identification
- Equipment planning and recommendations
- Weather and seeing condition analysis

### Learning from Feedback
The system improves over time:
- Fine-tuning vision models on user data
- Learning user preferences
- Adapting to equipment characteristics
- Building knowledge base from interactions

## Technical Challenges

### Vision Model Accuracy
Astronomical images differ significantly from natural images:
- Solved by fine-tuning on astronomical datasets
- Data augmentation for various imaging conditions
- Ensemble models for robust detection
- Uncertainty quantification for predictions

### Agent Coordination
Orchestrating multiple agents effectively:
- Clear task decomposition strategies
- Efficient communication protocols
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Monitoring and debugging tools

### Database Integration
Querying diverse astronomical databases:
- Unified query interface across catalogs
- Caching strategies for performance
- Handling API rate limits
- Data normalization and validation

## Results & Usage

- Successfully processes 100+ images per day
- Identifies objects with 95%+ accuracy
- Reduces manual research time by 70%
- Active use in my personal astrophotography workflow

## Open Source

The project is open source on GitHub with:
- Comprehensive documentation
- Example workflows and tutorials
- Community contributions welcome
- Regular updates and improvements

## Future Development

- Mobile app for field use
- Real-time sky monitoring
- Integration with telescope control
- Community sharing platform
- Support for spectroscopy data
