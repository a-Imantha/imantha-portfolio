## Overview

A serverless AWS security auditing tool that automatically scans AWS environments for common security misconfigurations and compliance issues. Built to help identify security gaps before they become incidents.

## Features

### Automated Security Checks
- S3 bucket public access settings
- IAM policy analysis for overprivileged access
- Security group rules inspection
- Unencrypted resources detection
- CloudTrail logging verification
- MFA enforcement status

### Scheduled Scanning
- EventBridge triggers for daily/weekly scans
- Configurable scan scope (accounts, regions, resources)
- Incremental scanning for large environments
- Historical trend tracking

### Reporting
- Detailed findings with severity levels
- Actionable remediation steps
- Summary dashboards
- Email reports via SES
- JSON export for integration with other tools

## Architecture

**Serverless Components:**
- **Lambda Functions:** Security scanning logic in Python
- **EventBridge:** Scheduled trigger orchestration
- **SES:** Email notification delivery
- **S3:** Report storage and audit logs
- **CloudFormation/SAM:** Infrastructure provisioning

**Security Checks:**
- Boto3 SDK for AWS API interactions
- Custom policy analysis engine
- Compliance framework mapping (CIS, AWS Well-Architected)

## Technical Implementation

### Lambda Functions
Modular design with separate functions for:
- Resource discovery and inventory
- Security rule evaluation
- Report aggregation and formatting
- Notification dispatching

### Infrastructure as Code
Full deployment automation:
```yaml
# SAM template defining all resources
- Lambda functions with appropriate IAM roles
- EventBridge rules for scheduling
- S3 buckets with versioning and encryption
- SES configuration for email delivery
```

### Cost Optimization
- Minimal runtime through efficient AWS API calls
- Incremental scanning to avoid full scans
- Serverless pricing model (pay per scan)
- Typical monthly cost: < $5 for small environments

## Impact

- Identified critical security issues in personal AWS accounts
- Automated compliance checking process
- Reduced manual audit time from hours to minutes
- Educational tool for learning AWS security best practices

## Technologies

**Cloud:** AWS Lambda, EventBridge, SES, S3, CloudFormation, SAM  
**Language:** Python 3.9+  
**Libraries:** Boto3, Jinja2 (report templates)  
**Tools:** AWS CLI, SAM CLI
