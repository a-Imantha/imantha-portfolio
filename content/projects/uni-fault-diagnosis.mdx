## Overview

Undergraduate capstone project developing an intelligent, standalone fault diagnosis system for three-phase induction motors. The system uses machine learning to detect and classify motor faults in real-time, enabling predictive maintenance and preventing catastrophic failures.

## Publication

**Title:** "Predictive and Standalone Fault Diagnosis System for Induction Motors"  
**Journal:** Engineer - Journal of the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL)  
**Year:** 2021  
**Authors:** Imantha Ahangama et al.

## Motivation

Induction motors are workhorses of industry, but unexpected failures cause:
- Costly downtime and production losses
- Safety hazards for workers
- Damage to connected equipment
- Expensive emergency repairs

Traditional monitoring requires expert analysis. Our system automates fault detection using ML, making predictive maintenance accessible even to smaller operations.

## System Design

### Hardware Architecture
**Embedded Platform:** Raspberry Pi 3B+
- Sufficient processing for real-time ML inference
- GPIO for sensor interfacing
- Network connectivity for remote monitoring
- Cost-effective for industrial deployment

**Sensors:**
- Current sensors (3-phase)
- Vibration sensors (accelerometer)
- Temperature sensors
- Motor speed encoder

### Software Components

**Data Acquisition:**
- Real-time sensor data collection
- Signal conditioning and filtering
- Sampling at appropriate frequencies
- Circular buffer for continuous monitoring

**Feature Extraction:**
- Time-domain features (RMS, peak, crest factor)
- Frequency-domain analysis (FFT, harmonics)
- Statistical features (mean, variance, skewness)
- Motor-specific features (slip, power factor)

**ML Classification:**
- Multi-class classifier trained on fault signatures
- MATLAB for model development and validation
- Python (scikit-learn) for embedded inference
- Support for various fault types:
  - Bearing faults
  - Stator winding faults
  - Rotor bar faults
  - Misalignment
  - Unbalance

**User Interface:**
- Java Swing desktop application
- Real-time data visualization
- Fault alerts and notifications
- Historical trend analysis
- System configuration and calibration

## Machine Learning Approach

### Dataset
- Experimental data from motors with induced faults
- Simulation data from motor models
- Balanced dataset across fault classes
- Multiple operating conditions (load, speed)

### Models Evaluated
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks
- K-Nearest Neighbors

**Best Performance:** SVM with RBF kernel achieving 95%+ accuracy

### Model Deployment
- Model serialization for embedded deployment
- Optimization for Raspberry Pi constraints
- Inference time < 100ms for real-time operation
- Periodic retraining capability

## Technical Challenges

**Real-Time Processing**
- Signal processing on embedded hardware
- Meeting latency requirements for safety-critical faults
- Efficient feature computation

**Robustness**
- Handling noisy industrial environments
- Adapting to varying motor loads and speeds
- False positive/negative trade-offs

**Deployment**
- Standalone operation without cloud dependency
- Reliability for 24/7 operation
- Easy installation and commissioning

## Results

### Fault Detection Performance
- **Accuracy:** 95%+ across all fault types
- **False Positive Rate:** < 3%
- **Inference Time:** ~80ms (real-time capable)
- **Detection Latency:** Faults detected within seconds of onset

### Practical Validation
- Tested on laboratory test bench
- Validation with multiple motor sizes (0.5-5 HP)
