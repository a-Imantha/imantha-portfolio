## Overview

Fleet Planner is an enterprise solution for airline fleet maintenance planning and optimization. I worked on integrating a sophisticated scheduling engine that enabled major airlines to efficiently plan maintenance schedules across their entire fleet while balancing resource constraints, regulatory requirements, and operational demands.

## Technical Contributions

### Scheduling Engine Integration
- Integrated third-party scheduling engine with Fleet Planner core system
- Developed optimization algorithms for aircraft maintenance slot allocation across multiple maintenance facilities
- Implemented constraint-based scheduling logic accounting for aircraft availability, maintenance bay capacity, and technician resources

## Architecture

Built on IFS Aurena framework with Oracle database backend, leveraging AWS services for scalability. The scheduling engine processed maintenance requirements, aircraft availability, and resource constraints to generate optimal maintenance plans. Integration layer synchronized data between airline ERP systems and Fleet Planner in near real-time.

## Impact

- Worked with a major global airline, managing fleets of 100+ aircraft
- Reduced maintenance planning time from days to hours through automated scheduling
- Improved aircraft utilization by optimizing maintenance slot allocation
- Enhanced schedule reliability by incorporating real-time constraint validation
