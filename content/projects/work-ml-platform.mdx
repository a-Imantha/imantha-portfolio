## Overview

As Machine Learning Engineering Lead at CML Insights, I architect and implement end-to-end ML solutions spanning multiple products in educational and financial domains. My role encompasses infrastructure design, MLOps implementation, database architecture, and hands-on development of production ML systems.

## Products & Solutions

### CML Insights App
Core analytics platform providing ML-powered insights for educational assessment and intervention.
- Microservices architecture on Kubernetes
- Real-time data processing pipelines
- Custom ML models for predictive analytics
- RESTful APIs with comprehensive authentication

### Evidence Hub Ecosystem
Two-part solution for evidence collection and curation:

**Evidence Hub App**
- Mobile and web data collection system
- Multi-modal evidence capture (text, image, video)
- Offline-first architecture with sync capabilities

**Evidence Hub Curator App**
- Content management and review workflows
- ML-assisted tagging and categorization
- Admin dashboards for quality control

### Fair Appraisal App
ML-driven appraisal and evaluation system:
- Automated scoring algorithms
- Bias detection and fairness metrics
- Explainable AI for decision transparency

## Technical Architecture

### MLOps Infrastructure
Built comprehensive MLOps pipelines enabling rapid experimentation and deployment:

**Orchestration**
- Kubeflow Pipelines for ML workflows
- MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry
- Dagster for data pipeline orchestration
- Custom automation for model versioning and deployment

**Infrastructure as Code**
- Terraform modules for AWS resource provisioning
- Kustomize for Kubernetes configuration management
- GitOps workflows with ArgoCD
- Automated environment provisioning (dev/staging/prod)

**Monitoring & Observability**
- Grafana dashboards for system and ML metrics
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Loki for log aggregation
- Alert Manager for proactive incident response

### Authentication & API Gateway
- Keycloak for identity and access management
- Kong Gateway for API routing and rate limiting
- OAuth 2.0 and OIDC implementations
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Database Design
Designed normalized schemas optimizing for:
- High-throughput ML feature access
- Transaction consistency for application data
- Efficient querying for analytics workloads
- PostgreSQL with read replicas and connection pooling

### ML Capabilities
- Scikit-learn for classical ML models
- PyTorch for deep learning applications
- Dask for distributed data processing
- Integration with OpenAI API for LLM features
- Hugging Face model deployment

## Notable Client Projects

### Kids Read Now
Educational literacy program serving thousands of students:
- ML models predicting reading progress and intervention needs
- Data pipelines processing reading assessments
- Dashboards for educators and administrators
- Scalable infrastructure handling peak loads

### JG Wentworth
Financial services ML solutions:
- Risk assessment models
- Document processing with NLP
- Secure data handling complying with financial regulations

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Scalability
**Challenge:** Handle variable loads across multiple products  
**Solution:** Kubernetes HPA with custom metrics; microservices isolation; asynchronous processing with message queues

### Deployment Velocity
**Challenge:** Reduce time from model training to production  
**Solution:** Automated CI/CD pipelines; containerized deployments; feature flags for safe rollouts; comprehensive testing automation

### Data Privacy & Security
**Challenge:** Handle sensitive educational and financial data  
**Solution:** Encryption at rest and in transit; audit logging; compliance with FERPA and SOC 2; regular security audits

### Cost Optimization
**Challenge:** Manage infrastructure costs while maintaining performance  
**Solution:** Right-sizing resources; spot instances for batch workloads; intelligent caching; query optimization
