## Why AWS?

AWS provides comprehensive cloud services that enable building scalable, reliable applications. Its breadth of services and maturity make it ideal for production workloads.

## Key Services I Use

### Compute
- **EKS:** Managed Kubernetes for container orchestration
- **Lambda:** Serverless compute for event-driven tasks
- **EC2:** Flexible virtual machines when needed

### Storage
- **S3:** Object storage for data lakes and backups
- **EBS:** Block storage for databases
- **EFS:** Shared file storage for multi-pod access

### Database
- **RDS:** Managed PostgreSQL and MySQL
- **ElastiCache:** Redis for caching
- **DynamoDB:** NoSQL for key-value workloads

### Networking
- **VPC:** Network isolation and security
- **ALB/NLB:** Load balancing
- **CloudFront:** CDN for static assets
- **Route 53:** DNS management

## My Experience

### ML Platform Infrastructure

Built production ML infrastructure on AWS:
- **EKS Cluster:** Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- **S3 Data Lake:** Centralized storage for training data and models
- **RDS PostgreSQL:** Feature store and metadata
- **ElastiCache:** Feature caching for low-latency inference
- **CloudWatch:** Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### Architecture Highlights

**Cost Optimization**
- Spot instances for batch training
- S3 lifecycle policies for data archival
- Reserved instances for baseline compute
- Resource tagging and cost allocation

**Security**
- VPC with private subnets
- Security groups and NACLs
- IAM roles and policies
- Secrets Manager for credentials
- CloudTrail for audit logging

**Reliability**
- Multi-AZ deployments
- Automated backups
- CloudWatch alarms
- Auto-scaling groups
- Route 53 health checks

## Infrastructure as Code

I use Terraform for managing AWS infrastructure:
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Reproducible environments
- State management with S3 backend
- Modular, reusable configurations

## Best Practices

- Follow the Well-Architected Framework
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys
- Enable CloudTrail and Config
- Implement proper tagging strategy
- Regular security audits
- Cost monitoring and optimization
- Multi-region for critical workloads
