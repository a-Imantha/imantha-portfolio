## Why Go?

Go (Golang) is my language of choice for building high-performance backend services. Its simplicity, built-in concurrency, and excellent standard library make it ideal for distributed systems.

## Key Strengths

### Performance
- Compiled to native code for speed
- Efficient memory management
- Low latency and high throughput
- Small binary sizes for containers

### Concurrency
Go's concurrency model is exceptional:
- Goroutines for lightweight threading
- Channels for safe communication
- Select statements for multiplexing
- Built-in race detector

### Tooling
The Go ecosystem includes:
- Fast compilation
- Built-in testing framework
- Code formatting with gofmt
- Dependency management with modules
- Powerful profiling tools

## My Experience

I've used Go extensively for:
- ML model serving infrastructure
- High-throughput API services
- Microservices architectures
- CLI tools and automation

In my ML platform work, Go was crucial for achieving sub-100ms latency at scale while maintaining code simplicity.

## Best Practices

- Embrace simplicity and readability
- Use interfaces for abstraction
- Handle errors explicitly
- Leverage the standard library
- Write idiomatic Go code
