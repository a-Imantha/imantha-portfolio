## Why Kubeflow?

Kubeflow is the Kubernetes-native ML platform I use for orchestrating complex ML workflows at scale. It provides the building blocks for production ML systems on Kubernetes.

## Key Components I Use

### Kubeflow Pipelines
- DAG-based workflow orchestration
- Reusable pipeline components
- Experiment tracking integration
- Scheduled and triggered runs

### Notebooks
- Jupyter notebooks on Kubernetes
- GPU/CPU resource allocation
- Persistent volumes for data
- Collaboration and sharing

### Training Operators
- Distributed training support
- TensorFlow, PyTorch operators
- Resource management
- Fault tolerance

### Serving
- Model deployment and serving
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- A/B testing support
- Canary deployments

## My Experience

At CML Insights, I've built comprehensive ML pipelines using Kubeflow:

**Data Pipelines**
- Ingestion from multiple sources
- Transformation and feature engineering
- Validation and quality checks
- Feature store integration

**Training Pipelines**
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Distributed training workflows
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- Model validation and testing

**Deployment Pipelines**
- Automated model deployment
- Smoke testing in staging
- Progressive rollout to production
- Monitoring integration

## Architecture

Kubeflow on EKS with:
- S3 for pipeline artifacts
- PostgreSQL for metadata
- MLflow for model registry
- ArgoCD for deployment

## Benefits

- Kubernetes-native workflows
- Resource efficiency
- Reproducible experiments
- Version-controlled pipelines
- Team collaboration
