## Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is my platform of choice for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale. It provides powerful abstractions for handling complex distributed systems.

## Key Concepts

### Workload Management
Kubernetes offers flexible workload types:
- Deployments for stateless applications
- StatefulSets for databases and stateful services
- Jobs and CronJobs for batch processing
- DaemonSets for node-level services

### Service Discovery & Networking
Built-in networking capabilities:
- Services for stable endpoints
- Ingress for HTTP routing
- Network policies for security
- Service mesh integration (Istio, Linkerd)

### Scaling & Resilience
Automatic scaling and recovery:
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
- Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)
- Self-healing through health checks
- Rolling updates and rollbacks

## My Experience

I've built production Kubernetes infrastructure for:
- ML model serving at scale
- Microservices architectures
- Data processing pipelines
- Multi-tenant applications

### ML Platform on Kubernetes

In my ML platform work, I leveraged Kubernetes for:
- **Custom Operators:** Built CRDs for model deployment lifecycle
- **Auto-scaling:** HPA based on inference queue depth
- **Resource Management:** GPU scheduling and optimization
- **High Availability:** Multi-zone deployments with 99.9% uptime

### Best Practices

**Resource Management**
- Set appropriate requests and limits
- Use resource quotas for namespaces
- Leverage node affinity and taints
- Monitor resource utilization

**Security**
- RBAC for access control
- Network policies for isolation
- Pod security policies
- Secret management with external systems

**Observability**
- Prometheus for metrics
- Centralized logging with ELK or Loki
- Distributed tracing
- Custom dashboards and alerts

## Tools & Ecosystem

- **Helm:** Package management
- **ArgoCD:** GitOps deployments
- **Cert-manager:** TLS certificate automation
- **Prometheus Operator:** Monitoring
- **Istio:** Service mesh
- **Kustomize:** Configuration management
