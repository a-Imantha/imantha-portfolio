# Kustomize

Kubernetes-native configuration management system. Customize Kubernetes objects through overlays without modifying original YAML files.

## Key Features

- **Template-free**: Pure YAML customization
- **Overlays**: Environment-specific configurations
- **Built-in to kubectl**: Native Kubernetes integration
- **Reusability**: Base and overlay pattern
- **GitOps**: Works well with CI/CD pipelines

## My Experience

Managed Kubernetes configurations with Kustomize, maintained environment-specific overlays, and integrated with GitOps workflows.
