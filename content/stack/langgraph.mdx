# LangGraph

Advanced framework for building stateful multi-agent LLM applications. Extends LangChain with graph-based workflows and state management.

## Key Features

- **State Management**: Persistent application state
- **Graph Workflows**: Complex multi-step processes
- **Conditional Logic**: Dynamic routing and decision trees
- **Multi-agent**: Coordinated agent interactions
- **Cycles**: Iterative and feedback loops

## My Experience

Implemented sophisticated multi-agent systems for astronomical data analysis with complex state management and coordinated workflows.
