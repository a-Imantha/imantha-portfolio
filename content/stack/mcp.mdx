# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Protocol for enabling language models to interact with external tools and services. Provides standardized communication between AI systems and data sources.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Protocol**: Consistent interface for tools
- **Tool Integration**: Connect LLMs to external services
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation context
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools
- **Type Safety**: Structured inputs and outputs

## My Experience

Implemented MCP for connecting LLMs with astronomical databases and analysis tools, enabling intelligent data retrieval and processing workflows.
