## Why MLflow?

MLflow is my go-to platform for managing the complete ML lifecycle - from experimentation to production deployment. It provides essential tracking, reproducibility, and deployment capabilities without vendor lock-in.

## Core Components

### MLflow Tracking
- Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- Compare experiments and runs
- Organize with tags and notes
- Query API for programmatic access

### MLflow Projects
- Reproducible ML code packaging
- Conda/Docker environment specification
- Git integration for versioning
- Remote execution capabilities

### MLflow Models
- Standard model packaging format
- Multiple framework support
- Model serving with REST API
- Model registry for lifecycle management

### MLflow Registry
- Centralized model store
- Version management
- Stage transitions (staging → production)
- Annotations and descriptions

## My Experience at CML Insights

I've implemented MLflow as the core of our MLOps infrastructure:

**Experiment Tracking**
- Automated logging from training scripts
- Custom metrics for business KPIs
- Artifact storage (models, plots, data samples)
- Hyperparameter tracking

**Model Registry**
- Centralized model catalog
- Approval workflows for production
- Model lineage and dependencies
- Performance monitoring

**Deployment Pipeline**
- Models packaged in MLflow format
- Automated testing before promotion
- Kubernetes deployment integration
- Rollback capabilities

## Integration with Other Tools

- **Kubeflow** for orchestration
- **Kubernetes** for model serving
- **PostgreSQL** for backend store
- **S3** for artifact storage
- **Grafana** for metrics visualization

## Best Practices

- Consistent logging across all projects
- Semantic versioning for models
- Comprehensive artifact storage
- Automated model validation before promotion
- Clear model documentation and metadata
