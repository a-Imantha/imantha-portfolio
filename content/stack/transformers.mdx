# Transformers

HuggingFace's flagship library providing thousands of pre-trained models for natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal tasks. The industry standard for working with transformer architectures.

## Key Features

- **Pre-trained Models**: Access to BERT, GPT, T5, Llama, and thousands more
- **Easy Fine-tuning**: Simple APIs for model adaptation
- **Multi-framework**: Works with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX
- **Tokenizers**: Fast and efficient tokenization
- **Trainer API**: Simplified training loops

## My Experience

Used extensively for LLM fine-tuning, working with base models like GPT-Neo, Llama, and QWEN, and developing custom encoder architectures for astronomical data analysis.
