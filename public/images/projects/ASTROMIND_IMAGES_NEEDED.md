## Temporary Placeholders

Until you add real images, the site will show Next.js image placeholders. The projects are fully functional and will display all text content correctly.

## How to Add

1. Place images in the paths specified above
2. Ensure file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
4. Next.js will automatically optimize them

## Optional: Use Online Placeholders

You can temporarily use placeholder services:
- https://placehold.co/1200x675
- https://picsum.photos/1200/675

Or use any astronomy/tech-related stock photos until you have project-specific images.
